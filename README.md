# content.grandmen123.com

This Website serves as a web platform and "portal" for my content creation "career" online as Grandmen123. It was made as a part of my Public Business website, which is composed by this page, a services website, and a landing page and an unlisted third page.

This section is made up of a single page react app, with a custom RSS feed to grab my videos from YT.
