# content.grandmen123.com

This Website serves as a web platform and "portal" for my content creation "career" online as Grandmen123.

It's a simple HTML & CSS website using Bootstrap, and was developed as a part of an 100 day coding challenge for web development. It's made up of a single page devided into sections with scrollable navbar.


##### Running & Bug Finding
If you want to run the website to test for bugs or just mess around, all you have to do is download it and open the HTML files with your prefered browser. To run the PHP code you will likely need to run it on a Linux machine, or install PHP on windows (somehow).

Feel free to report bugs at the bug page here on GitHub and I'll address them!
