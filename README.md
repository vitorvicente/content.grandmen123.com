# content.grandmen123.com

This Website serves as a web platform and "portal" for my content creation "career" online as Grandmen123. It was made as a part of my Public Business website, which is composed by this page, a services website, and a landing page and an unlisted third page.

It's a simple HTML & CSS website using Bootstrap, and was developed as a part of an 100 day coding challenge for web development. It's made up of a single page devided into sections with scrollable navbar.
